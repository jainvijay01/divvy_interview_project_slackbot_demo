# divvy_interview_project_slackbot_demo

## Objective:
Build a slack bot using Python & its open source libraries. For example, you might choose to use the Bolt Library. Deploy this slackbot to AWS using Terraform, either to the EC2 free tier (with or without a docker container), Lightsail, or to AWS lambda with an API gateway, or any other method you’d choose.

## Bonus: 
Consider adding a CI/CD pipeline that will deploy code updates to your infrastructure of choice. You can use Github actions or any other CI/CD platform.

## Acceptance Criteria:
A slackbot that responds to input from a human or some other event. Deployed to AWS using Terraform.
